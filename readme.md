## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system(these version has been used while local development however older version may work):

- **Python 3.12.8 or later**
- **Node v20.18.0 or later**

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AA-IT-WebTechCourse/webshopproject2024-rifatshampod
cd webshopproject2024-rifatshampod
```

#### 2. Set up a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/Scripts/activate  # For Windows
# For macOS/Linux:
# source env/bin/activate
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. Apply Migrations

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

#### 5. Run the Development Backend Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Or

```bash
 python manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8000
```

Or

```bash
 python manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8000 --noreload
```

**note**: Make sure that backend server runs 8000 port and port is available locally. Incase the server is run on different port then .env file on frontend directory should be updated accordingly so that frontend can connect proper backend.

#### 6. Run the Development frontend server or locally in production mode

Production Mode (Faster Browsing)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
# npm run build
# The command should re-generate the build files from your machine
npm run start
```

Dev Mode (Slow Browsing)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

**note:**

- While running the application in development mode, you might need to refresh the browser for the first time to resolve any initial errors.
- This behavior is sporadic and does not occur in production mode.

#### 7. Validate the successful running servers

- Frontend UI: Visit http://localhost:5173/ in your browser to access the webshop.
- Backend Landing Page: Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to confirm the backend is running.

If both backend and frontend server runs properly then start browsing the application. There is optional to populate the database. Make sure to popuate to start the testing.
